    <h3>How to Sign Up:</h3> 
        <p class="det">Sign-ups are usually sent out early first term, and late term 3, for terms 1 and 4 respectively. You need a team of 2-3 people to play, and you can choose to be in a social, competitive, or premier competition. Most people choose to play competitively, for which you need to have an understanding of scoring, but you don&#39;t have to have experience or any sort of skill&#33; Social grades just have a hit, and don&#39;t do scoring, while premier grades are for more experienced players. </p>

    <h3>Playing Times:</h3> 
        <p class="det">Games are played at the logan park tennis courts, on Thursday afternoons. The first round (juniors) is played at 4:10-5:10, second round (seniors) is played 5:15-6:15. The games are played with half an hour of doubles, and half and hour of singles. You will be told what you are playing first when you arrive, or you can see on the draw, which is emailed to you during the week.</p>
    
    <h3>Coaching:</h3> 
        <p class="det">Coaching for boarders with Jim Hoffman is available at the hostel during Terms 1 and 4, this is done at 7am-8am at various mornings before school, which is negotiated with Mr Hoffman when you sign up. Talk to the matrons about this if you are interested and you are a boarder. 
            <br>
