    <p> Tennis for year 9-13 St Hilda&#39;s students is played during terms 1 and 4 at the Logan Park Tennis Courts. No experience is required, you just need a racket, and a team of 2-3 people. Many girls at St Hilda&#39;s, mostly those from year 9-12, (9+10 especially), choose to play tennis over the summer. </p>
